A Data-Based Look at Earthquakes","date":"2025-12-04","tags":["Data","Science"],"coverImage":"/images/eqb/2.jpg","content":"\nRecently, there has been some discussion about whether earthquakes in Bangladesh are changing — for example, happening closer to the surface or becoming stronger. Curious about this, I decided to look at the data myself and see what it really says.\n\n## What I Did\n\nI analyzed **1133 earthquakes** recorded in and around Bangladesh from **1985 to 2025**. For each earthquake, I looked at:\n\n* **Magnitude** (how strong the earthquake was)\n* **Depth** (how far underground it happened)\n* **Number of earthquakes per year**\n* **Energy released**\n* **Aftershocks and clusters**\n\nI also used **statistical tests** to check if any changes over time were real or just normal variations.\n\n---\n\n## What the Data Shows\n\n### 1. Earthquake Counts\n\n![img](/images/eqb/1.png)\n\nEarthquake numbers go up and down each year. Some years, like **2015**, had more earthquakes, and others, like **1985**, had very few. In **2025**, the number of earthquakes was slightly below average. This means **the number of earthquakes is not increasing dramatically**.\n\n### 2. Magnitude (Strength)\n\n![img](/images/eqb/3.png)\n\nMost earthquakes are moderate, around magnitude **4–5**. Strong earthquakes (M ≥ 6) happen occasionally but are rare. Over 40 years, the average and maximum magnitudes **have not increased**, so there is **no trend toward stronger earthquakes**.\n\n### 3. Depth\n\n![img](/images/eqb/5.png)\n\nMost earthquakes happen at shallow depths, roughly **10–60 km** underground. Statistical tests show that **there is no significant trend** of earthquakes becoming shallower or deeper over time.\n\n### 4. Energy\n\n![img](/images/eqb/4.png)\n\nThe total energy released by earthquakes varies from year to year. Some years, like **2011** and **2016**, released more energy due to larger quakes. **2025 is within the normal range**, meaning there is no unusual energy buildup.\n\n### 5. Aftershocks and Clusters\n\nMany earthquakes are followed by smaller aftershocks. Some areas also have **clusters or swarms** of small quakes. These patterns are **consistent with known tectonic structures** in Bangladesh and nearby regions. Nothing unusual appears in the recent data.\n\n### 6. Inter-Event Times\n\nThe time between earthquakes changes naturally. In 2025, earthquakes were slightly closer together than the long-term average, but this is **well within normal variation**.\n\n---\n\n## What This Means\n\nSome people have claimed that something dramatic is happening underground in Bangladesh. The data, however, does **not support this idea**. Over 40 years:\n\n* Earthquake counts are normal\n* Magnitudes are stable\n* Depth patterns have not changed significantly\n* Energy release is consistent with historical variation\n\nIn short, **Bangladesh’s earthquakes and the regions around are behaving as they have for decades**. There is no evidence of sudden changes or heightened seismic hazard.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnalyzing earthquake data scientifically helps separate **fact from fear**. While earthquakes are always a hazard, the patterns in Bangladesh **remain stable**. No dramatic underground changes are detected — at least, not yet.\n\nFor those interested in the full analysis, code, and data, it is available on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mehdihasan/bd-earthquake-analysis-2025).\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
