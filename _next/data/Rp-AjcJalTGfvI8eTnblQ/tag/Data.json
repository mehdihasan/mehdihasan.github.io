A Data-Based Look at Earthquakes","date":"2025-12-04","tags":["Data","Science"],"coverImage":"/images/eqb/earthquake_animation.gif","author":"Mehdi Hasan","content":"\nRecent weeks have raised public concern in Bangladesh after several noticeable earthquakes shook the Dhaka–Narsingdi region. Many people are wondering: *Is this the start of something dangerous? Has seismic activity suddenly increased?* To answer these questions, we analyzed decades of earthquake data across Bangladesh and compared it with the events of 2025. Here is what the numbers — not rumors — actually show.\n\n## **What the long-term data tells us**\n\nA full historical catalog of 465 earthquakes (1976–2025) shows that Bangladesh experiences regular moderate seismicity. The recent activity sits within long-term patterns, but several features of **2025 stand out scientifically**:\n\n### **Energy release in 2025 is higher than average**\n\nThis year’s events have released about **1.65× more seismic energy** than the historical yearly average. That increase is driven mainly by the **M5.4 earthquake on November 21**, the largest event of the year.\n\n![img](/images/eqb/seismic_eng_per_yr.png)\n\n### **Event counts are *not* unusually high**\n\nStatistical tests show that **2025 has a normal number of earthquakes** — no spike in the *frequency* of events.\n\n![img](/images/eqb/e_count.png)\n\n### **Magnitudes remain in the typical range**\n\nThe distribution of earthquake magnitudes in 2025 does **not differ significantly** from previous decades.\n\n![img](/images/eqb/mag_distribution.png)\n\n![img](/images/eqb/mag_bin.png)\n\n### **Depth is where things get interesting**\n\nMultiple tests show that **2025 earthquakes are noticeably shallower** than in most previous years. Shallow earthquakes are felt more strongly at the surface, even if their magnitudes are moderate.\n\n![img](/images/eqb/median_quake_depth.png)\n\nThis is one of the most important findings: **No unusual increase in the number of earthquakes — but the ones occurring are shallower, so they feel stronger.**\n\n![img](/images/eqb/depth_dis.png)\n\n## **Understanding the recent sequence near Dhaka / Narsingdi**\n\nSo far, four earthquakes attracted public attention in late November and early December:\n\n| Date (UTC) | Mag | Depth | Location        |\n|------------|-----|-------|-----------------|\n| Nov 21     | 5.4 | 27 km | Narsingdi (SSW) |\n| Nov 22     | 4.3 | 10 km | Narsingdi (W)   |\n| Nov 27     | 4.0 | 10 km | Tungi (NNE)     |\n| Dec 4      | 4.1 | 10 km | Dhaka (ESE)     |\n\nThe **21 November M5.4 earthquake** is almost certainly the **mainshock**, assuming no larger event occurred shortly before or after it. Terms like *mainshock* or *foreshock* are assigned **after** the fact, once the full sequence is known. The three subsequent earthquakes — magnitudes **4.0 to 4.3** over the following two weeks — fit the pattern of **aftershocks**, which is the normal and expected response of the crust after a moderate event like this.\n\nAftershock models and cluster analysis support this:\n\n- Spatially close\n- Shallow\n- Occurred soon after the M5.4\n- Magnitudes appropriate for aftershocks\n\nThere is **no scientific indication** that the sequence is an \"ongoing mega-event\" or a sign of an imminent major catastrophe.\n\n![img](/images/eqb/quake_clusters.png)\n\n## **Should people be worried?**\n\n### **Short answer: No panic — but yes, be prepared.**\n\nBased on the data:\n\n- There is **no evidence** of a large earthquake building up in the immediate future.\n- The pattern fits a **normal mainshock–aftershock sequence**.\n- Bangladesh’s long-term seismic environment is active, but this year is not unprecedented.\n\nThat said, shallow earthquakes, even at moderate magnitudes, can **shake cities hard**, especially in cities like Dhaka with probably thousands of vulnerable buildings. This means:\n\n- **Risk exists**\n- **But it is manageable**\n- **Preparedness is the key difference-maker**\n\n## **Why shallow earthquakes matter more**\n\nOur analysis found a statistically significant shift toward shallower depths in 2025. This is important because:\n\n- A shallow M4–M5 can feel like a deeper M6 in terms of surface shaking.\n- Dhaka has many old and unreinforced structures that are more sensitive to this kind of shaking.\n- Even without a major earthquake, shallow moderate events can cause injuries, wall collapses, and infrastructure disruption.\n\nSo the message is not \"a big earthquake is coming.\"\nThe message is: **a moderate earthquake can still be damaging if buildings are fragile — so strengthen preparedness now.**\n\n## **What people and communities can do right now**\n\n### **A. Stay informed without panic**\n\nFollow official bulletins from:\n\n- Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD)\n- National Disaster Response agencies\n- Universities or credible institutions\n\n**Please avoid unverified social media rumors.**\n\n### **B. Community organization**\n\n- Form **local volunteer preparedness groups** in neighborhoods.\n- Identify safe open spaces.\n- Help elderly or disabled neighbors with emergency planning.\n- Practice evacuation routes.\n\n### **C. Training and drills**\n\nPush local authorities and community leaders to:\n\n- Organize **earthquake safety workshops**.\n- Conduct **drop–cover–hold-on drills** in schools, offices, and markets.\n- Teach people how to check homes for hazards (loose shelves, falling objects, unsecured gas cylinders).\n\n### **D. Structural safety**\n\nCitizens and journalists should push authorities to:\n\n- Enforce building codes more strictly.\n- Inspect vulnerable buildings, especially schools and hospitals.\n- Provide public guidance on strengthening old structures.\n\n### **E. Spread helpful information**\n\nLocal organizations can print simple, factual pamphlets covering:\n\n- What to do during shaking\n- How to prepare emergency kits\n- Where to gather after an earthquake\n- How aftershocks behave\n- What NOT to believe on social media\n\nHelping people understand what is normal in an earthquake sequence reduces fear — and that improves safety.\n\n## **Final takeaway**\n\n**No, Bangladesh is not currently experiencing a dramatic, unprecedented seismic crisis.**\nBut **yes**, 2025’s earthquakes — especially the shallow M5.4 near Narsingdi — remind us that Bangladesh sits in an active tectonic region where moderate earthquakes can be strongly felt.\n\n- The number of earthquakes is normal.\n- Magnitudes are normal.\n- **Depths are shallower**, so shaking feels stronger.\n- The recent events fit a **mainshock–aftershock pattern**.\n- Preparedness, not panic, is the appropriate response.\n\nEarthquakes cannot be stopped, but **knowledge, training, and readiness** can prevent injuries and save lives. The best time to prepare is **before** a larger earthquake happens — and these recent events give Bangladesh a valuable opportunity to do exactly that.\n\nFor those interested in the full analysis, code, and data, it is available on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mehdihasan/bd-earthquake-analysis-2025).\n\n## Verified Sources Covering 2025 Earthquake\n\n1.
