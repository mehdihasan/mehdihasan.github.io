          My Story
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          From the vibrant streets of Bangladesh to the innovative tech hubs of Sweden, my journey has been one of curiosity, resilience, and continuous learning.
          <br /><br />
          I started as a network engineer, solving real-world connectivity challenges, and soon found myself drawn to the world of softwareâ€”building mobile apps, architecting backend systems, and leading teams across continents.
          <br /><br />
          Each chapter brought new lessons: launching products for startups, scaling data platforms for global enterprises, and mentoring others to grow alongside me.
          <br /><br />
          Today, I specialize in distributed systems and data engineering, passionate about designing solutions that empower people and organizations. My story is still being written, fueled by a love for technology, travel, and the endless possibilities of learning.
